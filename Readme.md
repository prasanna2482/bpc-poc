# Business Policy Concession

A BPC budget is available so that Eaton Electrical can be responsive to customer needs and disputes over controversial issues. If the issue is not a field sales error or a product performance related issue, field sales can initiate a BPC claim. BPC provides managers with an excellent tool to "do the right thing" commercially on behalf of Eaton. The Zone BPC account is intended to be used as a vehicle to make a commercial concession to a valued customer that is above and beyond Eatonâ€™s normal contractual responsibility. Field sales errors should be covered by using the local field sales concession account (Z-account).
Product Lines should normally be the source of total or partial funds for a concession when product line quality is the root cause of the problem on which the claim is based.BPC is NOT intended to be used to cover contractual warranty expenses that are clearly the responsibility of a product line.
